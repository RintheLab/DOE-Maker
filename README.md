DOE-Maker
================

A basic Shiny app to design factorial, fractional and response surface experiments.

You can use DOE Maker through three options:

#### 1

Simply download it from this GitHub page or through GitHub Desktop. Once in DOEMaker main directory, just double click the .Rproj file and type in the R console (you need devtools package):

`devtools::laod_all(".")`

and then:

`DOEMaker()`

To do the above, you can also run the file app.R in DOEMaker main directory.

#### 2

Install the app as a package with the next code:

`devtools::install_github("jpch26/DOE-Maker")`

then:

`library(DOEMaker)`

and finally:

`DOEMaker()`

#### 3

Use the app directly, you do not need R or RStudio, by clicking in the next link:

https://r-inthelab-net.shinyapps.io/doemaker/

 

The third will not be a long term option to use the app because shinyapp.io just allow to publish five apps simultaneously, with some limitations.
